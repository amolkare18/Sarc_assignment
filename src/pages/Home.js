        Our Vision

We share the vision of Dr. Sukhatme, Director of IIT Bombay, as expressed at the Chicago summit meeting in September 1999 – “I dream of an IIT which never forgets that it has a tryst with excellence”. The core aim of both IITBHF and IITBAA is to bring together the diligent minds of IITB’s alumni and make IITB one of the leading research and teaching institutes in the world.

The Institute utilizes wisely the generous donations, bequests, gifts, and grants received from the alumni, chapters, benefactors, corporations, and trusts for education and research purposes.
